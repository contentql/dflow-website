dFlow let's you connect to your AWS account and manage your cloud resources
without leaving the dFlow interface. You can create, update, and delete
resources, as well as view their status and logs.

## Connect your AWS account

To connect your AWS account, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [**Integrations**](https://demo.dflow.sh/integrations) section in
   dFlow.
2. Click on the **Settings** button on the AWS card.
3. Click on the **Connect Account** button.
4. Enter a name for your AWS account.
5. Enter the **Access key ID** and **Secret access key** you copied earlier. You
   can obtain these keys from the AWS IAM console. If you don't have an access
   key, you can create one by following the instructions in the
   [Create IAM Role](#create-iam-role) section.

<Callout type='info'>
  Both the **Access key ID** and **Secret access key** are encrypted before
  being stored in our database. This means that even if someone gains access to
  our database, they won't be able to see your AWS credentials.
</Callout>
6. Click on the **Save** button.

Your AWS account is now connected to dFlow ðŸŽ‰.

### Create IAM Role

dFlow requires an IAM(Identity and Access Management) role to access your AWS
account. This role must have permissions to create and manage resources in your
account. You can create a new IAM role or use an existing one. If you choose to
create a new role or use the existing one, make sure to attach the necessary
policies to it. The following policies are required:

<Callout type='info'>
  **EC2FullAccess**: This policy allows dFlow to create and manage EC2
  instances.
</Callout>

Follow these steps to create an IAM role with the necessary permissions:

1. Log in to your AWS account & navigate to dashboard.
2. Search for IAM in the search bar and click on it.
3. Select **Users**.
4. Click **Create user** button.
5. Enter username and click **next**.
6. In the permissions tab, select **Attach policies directly**.
7. Search for **EC2FullAccess** and select it.
8. Click **next** and then **Create user**.
9. Click on the user you just created.
10. Click on **Create access key**.
11. Select **Other** and click **next**.
12. Add **optional description** and click **Create access key**.
13. Copy the **Access key ID** and **Secret access key**.

<Callout type='warn'>
  Currently dFlow only allows you to create EC2 instances, soon you can connect
  your existing EC2 instances and manage them from dFlow.
</Callout>

### Create EC2 instance

To create an EC2 instance, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [**Servers**](https://demo.dflow.sh/settings/servers) section in
   dFlow.

3. Select **AWS** as the provider.
4. Give name and optional description to your server.
5. Select your AWS account from the dropdown.
6. Select **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**.
