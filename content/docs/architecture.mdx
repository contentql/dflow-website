When Dflow is installed, it will setup the following:

- Built using **Next.js** for the frontend and backend API.
- Uses **MongoDB** as the primary database to store user, server, and service
  details. **PayloadCMS**
- **Redis** is used for caching and fast data retrieval.
- **BullMQ** (built on Redis) is used for queueing and managing long-running
  tasks like server provisioning and service deployments.
